-- -- -- ðŸ”º Aggregate Functions

-- COUNT() - count the number of rows
-- SUM() - the sum of the values in a column
-- MAX() / MIN() - the largest/smallest value
-- AVG() - the average of the values in a column
-- ROUND() - round the values in the column
-- GROUP BY - is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
-- HAVING - limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property.

-- The WHERE clause filters rows, whereas the HAVING clause filter groups.

-- Count example
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps
WHERE price = 0;

-- Sum example
SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

-- Max / Min example
SELECT MAX(price)
